# Workforce_Intelligence

The goal of this study is to predict how long as a person been in the workforce, where the age of the user provides a fair enough proxy.

I make use of public LinkedIn profile data (and if you've noticed, LinkedIn does not expose age or year of birth of users in public profile view), 
we completely rely on predicting a user's age using factors including the positions they have held (and when, if available), the degrees they have 
obtained (and when, if available) et cetera. For this scenario, I have to deal with prediction tasks with little (via. some proxy) to no ground truth 
availability.
